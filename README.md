# AI-YahtzeeGame
The Yahtzee with AI (Q-Learning) project implements the classic Yahtzee dice game, where a human player competes against an AI trained using Q-Learning. The game consists of 13 rounds, during which each player rolls 5 dice up to three times and selects a scoring category from options like Three of a Kind, Full House, or Yahtzee (five identical dice). The AI learns to make optimal decisions through a system of rewards and penalties, choosing strategies that maximize its final score. The implementation utilizes Python, with Pygame for game rendering, Tkinter for the user interface, NumPy for numerical operations, and JSON & OS for data storage and management. Meanwhile, the AI balances exploration and exploitation to improve its performance over time. 
Developing and fine-tuning the AI was a true challenge, but the result was impressive: in most cases, the AI achieved a significantly higher score than a competitive human player.ðŸš€ðŸŽ²
