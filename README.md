# AI-YahtzeeGame
The Yahtzee with AI (Q-Learning) project is a Python-based game where a human player competes against an AI trained with Q-Learning. The AI optimizes its strategy through rewards and penalties, consistently outperforming human players. Built with Pygame, Tkinter, NumPy, JSON &amp; OS, this project was a fun and challenging experience! ðŸš€ðŸŽ²
